## Summary

_lofi Studio_ 1.0 is an intuitive beat-maker for those who enjoy the calming sounds of lofi, and for those who have yet to discover it. It is also a way to seamlessly mix lofi beats, so that your workflow or relaxation time will not be interupted by harsh volume differences or ads.

## Intended users 

* Students who have trouble finding lofi stations that don't include distracting features or abrupt changes in tempo or volume.
	
	> I love having lofi on in the background when i'm studying, but sometimes the track selection will take me out of the zone. I need something that will help me create a playlist of sounds that will keep me focused 100% of the time when im studying.

* Relaxation seekers who want better control of the music they listen to when relaxing.

	> As an avid wino, I need a way to create mixes that I can blackout to whilst enjoying some decently priced cab from Trader Joes in the tub.

* Aspiring producers or kids that want to learn the basics of beat making.

	> I want to be the next Dj Khaled, but I don't know the first thing about making beats! I need an easy-to-use program that will teach me the basics of song structure.
